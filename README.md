# In this repo
This repository is used as a playground to learn [ROS2](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html) and the tools needed for it. Specifically, it is used to learn using the [Nav2](https://navigation.ros.org/) ROS2 toolbox.
The software is mainly written in C++.

# Objectives
This project is quite large, so there are multiple objectives. They are summarized as follows:
- Setting up the development environments (e.g., using Github, Dockerfiles, webhooks, linters, etc.)
- Familiarization with [ROS2](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html).
- Running a full navigation pipeline in simulation using ROS2.
- Customizing the existing code for better performance (e.g., using g2o's factor graphs)
- Implementing the software on a real physical robot.
